# C++ Micro-Tutoring

## About

Micro-tutoring is a great way to quickly get up to speed with C++. 
CSC 212 assumes you already have a working knowledge of C++, the course is about using this language to build data structures and their requisite algorithms.
Lacking this core knowledge will make the entire semester incredibly difficult.
Micro-tutoring aims to provide a focused approach to any student wishing to improve their knowledge of C++.

## Schedule

### Week 1

> TAs will be available from Jan 30 to Feb 23 for individual (or small groups) tutoring sessions.

## Problem Sets

Along with the crash course in C++, micro-tutored students are required to complete weekly (additional) problem sets. 
These problem sets will be sourced from [Kattis](https://uri.kattis.com/courses/CSC212/Spring19), a site dedicated to hosting small programming challenges. 
Comprising of ~20 mandatory, and ~5 optional problems for the bored; they are designed to be challenging, yet rewarding.

## Focused Tutoring

During these sessions you will meet with your designated TA to go over the weekly problem sets. 
These sessions are intended to work on your ability to solve problems and your familiarity with the programming language, with TAs going so far as to walk you through solutions.

> Take advantage of these sessions, as the knowledged gained in problem solving can be invaluable.
